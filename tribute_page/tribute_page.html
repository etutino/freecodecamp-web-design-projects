    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Long before the first settlers, the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park was wilderness. American bison, elk, bobcats and wolves roamed forests of oak, hickory and beech. Native Americans later inhabited the land and avenues of trade were developed nearby. Such avenues included the Occoneechee trail to the north and the Pee Dee trail to the south. In 1774, land grants opened the area for settlement by Europeans. Forests were cleared as agricultural interests sprouted. While early farming efforts were successful, poor cultivation practices and one-crop production led to depletion and erosion of the soil. During the Depression, farmers made futile attempts to grow cotton in worn-out soil around Crabtree Creek. Mother and daughter farming in the fields near Crabtree Creek in what is now Umstead State Park, ca. 1900. From the collection of North Carolina State Parks.</p>
<p> In 1934, under the federal FarmResettlement Administration, federal and state agencies united to buy 5,000 acres of this submarginal land to develop a recreation area. The Civilian Conservation Corps, as well as the Works Progress Administration, under the direction of the National Park Service helped construct the site while providing much needed jobs. Four camps along with day-use and picnic facilities were built and the park opened to the public in 1937 as a National Park Service Demonstration Area Park. In 1943, The state purchased this area, known as Crabtree Creek Recreation Area, for $1, and more facilities were built as the General Assembly made its first state parks division appropriation in the 1940s. In 1950, more than 1,000 acres of the park were established as Reedy Creek State Park, a racially segregated park for African Americans. Crabtree Creek Recreation Area was renamed in 1955 after former Governor William Bradley Umstead in recognition of his conservation efforts. In 1966, the Crabtree Creek and Reedy Creek areas were desegregated and united under one park, the William B. Umstead State Park.</p>

 <h2>Chainsaw Art</h2>
 <p>A fallen red oak tree—approximately 25 feet long and several feet high—has been transformed by artists Jerry Redi and Randy Boni of Smoky Mountain Art. In mid-Nov., the pair spent a week using chainsaws to cut and carve away a series of animals, tree branches and leaves into the downed tree that lays just off the Graylyn multi-use trail—one of six multi-use trails inside the park that make up a total of 13 miles of paths available to hikers, cyclists and horseback riders</p>
